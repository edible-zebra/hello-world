learning to program, starting at the root
## When I first began my journey into web dev
It was around the summer of 2023 when I finally built my latest computer system with the intention to play around with Unreal Engine. I built a nice system, powered by an RTX 3070 LHR (which looking back I wish I would've opted for a 3080 instead.), an i5-12600k paired with 32GB of DDR4-3600mhz RAM. I was so excited when I finally finished the build, having put together everything I learned in the past from previous builds I was certain that this was my best work so far. I benchmarked it by running some of my favorite games, as well as some of the newer releases at the time and sure enough the system was everything I hoped for. If I had to describe the feeling, it was like when I came to America (15 years ago as of the time of writing this) and discovered the dusty PS3 which my American step dad kept in the living room. Being a retired Air Force veteran of 40 something years old, he had little passion for gaming and only had one game for the system, Metal Gear Solid 4; although as a young Romanian boy who grew up watching Hanna-Barbera reruns on Jetix, which were old even by that time, this machine was a whole new world to me. Looking back now I suppose it's ironic, as I truly had stepped into a new world when I entered America. Everything was different, we weren't worried about food or water, I had access to greater education, and the toilets had water in them before you even pushed the lever. --- 
This computer that I built was just like that PS3 those many years ago, it was a new world, an opportunity to do something I couldn't have dreamed of before. I booted up Unreal Engine 4 and it ran well, I used some of the prebuilt examples to test it out and play around, but I quickly came to a grim realization. I knew nothing about programming. I wasn't naive, I didn't think I was going to build a fancy new system, boot RE4 and magically became a game developer, but now that everything was at my fingertips it truly set in how tumultuous the task before me would be. I knew I would need to learn to program, but never took the time to think about where to begin, what language I'd need to learn, what IDE I'd use, how I create assets for my game. In that brief moment I believe my respect for game developers grew ever larger.
